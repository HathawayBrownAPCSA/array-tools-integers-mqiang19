Overall, the code looks good.
The algorithms are correct and the 

Except for one thing: it doesn't compile.
Too much copy-and-paste perhaps, but your getMin method includes a reference
  to min, which is not declared; you use MinNum.
Which is also "spelled" wrong - it should start with a lowercase letter.  (same in getMax)

I'm not quite sure how you didn't notice that this doesn't compile.

ALSO: The instructions said to include javadoc comments.  Yours don't take advantage of that tool.  
Put them in the JavaDoc format please (like the rest of the comments) and include @return comments.

And while we're on formatting: the standard indentation is two spaces (even here on GitHub - see above)
Other than getMax, your methods have only one space.  It's a good habit to follow established 
conventions - it is a sign to other people that you know what you're doing.

And also spacing: it's not as much of a standard, but it's genearlly considered good form to
have spaces between the letters and the symbols.  You have
   for( int i=0; i< arrayCount; i ++)
Better is
   for (int i = 0; i < arrayCount; i++)
   
Right now, 6/10.
8/10 when corrected and resubmitted.
